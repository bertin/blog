This project is a result from learning from Stephen Griders excellent course on udemy https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview
I started out with Stephens starter projects from his github page, and followed his instructions from the course.
Stephen Grider is THE most talented instructor I have ever experienced. 
Stephens courses is highly recommended when learning React and Redux.
